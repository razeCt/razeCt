- Hi, I’m @razeCt;
- I’m interested in website coding;
- I’m currently learning HTML and CSS (for the time being, I am new to it);
- I’m definetely not interested in being requested (again, for the time being);
- How to reach me: Not available (still not feeling like I want to share my social media for now).
