- Hi, I’m @razeCt;
- I’m currently studying and practicing website development;
- Funnily enough, i'm still learning / studying HTML, CSS and JS (front-end development) - It's taking longer than expected due to procastination (note: I updated this "README" in June 16th, 2024. Things have taken a different turn from last year - although I haven't yet progressed expressively).
