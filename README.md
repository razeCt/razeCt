- Hi, I’m @razeCt;
- I’m currently studying and practicing website development;
- Funnily enough, i'm still learning / studying HTML, CSS and JS (front-end development) - It's taking longer than expected due to procastination (note: I updated this read me in October 19th, 2023. Things might take a different turn from this date as I progress - and I hope it's for the best).
- How to reach me: Not available.
